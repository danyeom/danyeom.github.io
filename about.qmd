###  {#hero-heading}

I am a South Korean-born, Aotearoa New Zealand-raised researcher in behavioural genetics and music science. I completed a conjoint BSc/BMus at the University of Auckland, and a BSc (Hons) in psychology after that. I then moved to the University of Melbourne to pursue a PhD in the Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences.

In a previous life (i.e. before the PhD) I played solo fingerstyle guitar, and also electric bass for a local big band. I taught at a private music school for \~5 years during my undergraduate years.

My niche hobby (every academic has one) is building mechanical keyboards. (I may add a page to this site eventually.)
