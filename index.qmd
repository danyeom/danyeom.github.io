## **Hi there!**

I'm the lab manager of the Clinical and Music Neuroscience Lab in the Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, The University of Melbourne. I'm also a PhD candidate in the School.

My research focuses around the behavioural genetics of human musicality - that is, the various behavioural and cognitive traits that influence our capacity to be musical, in all of its forms.

This page is a work in progress but I hope to add to it soon! I recently switched over from using Bookdown + Hugo to Quarto for this website, so things are still missing from this new page.
