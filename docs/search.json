    "text": "I am a South Korean-born, Aotearoa New Zealand-raised researcher in behavioural genetics and music science. I completed a conjoint BSc (in psychology) and BMus (in musicology and music education) at the University of Auckland, and a BSc (Hons) in psychology after that. I then moved to the University of Melbourne to pursue a PhD in the Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences.\nIn a previous life (i.e. before the PhD) I played solo fingerstyle guitar, and also electric bass for a local big band. I taught at a private music school for ~5 years during my undergraduate years.\nMy niche hobby (every academic has one) is building mechanical keyboards. (I may add a page to this site eventually.)"

Our team is investigating the genetic bases of singing ability, and how these interact with environmental influences to shape its development over life.\nThis work is supported by two Australian Research Council Discovery Project Grants (DP170102479 and DP200100961) and an Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.\n\n\nInvestigating musical identities\nCo-investigators: Dr. Amanda Krause (James Cook University), A/Prof. Melissa Forbes (University of Southern Queensland)\nHow do sociocultural factors shape people’s musical identities? How do people come to view themselves as “musicians” or similar? We are investigating what factors shape the various musical identities people take on, and how this relates to musical engagement.\n\n\nThe Musical Lives of Children in Aotearoa: Evidence from a longitudinal cohort study\nCo-investigators: Dr. Rebecca Evans (Auckland University of Technology), Dr. Ryan Ip (Auckland University of Technology), Dr. Ben Fletcher (University of Auckland), Dr. Bronya Dean (University of Waikato)\nUsing the Growing Up in New Zealand study, Aotearoa New Zealand’s largest longitudinal study of child development, we are looking at a) predictors of musical engagement throughout the first 12 years of life, and b) how engaging with music is related to psychosocial and wellbeing outcomes in turn.\n\n\nExamining trends in music psychology research\nCo-investigators: Prof. Gary McPherson\nTBA!"
